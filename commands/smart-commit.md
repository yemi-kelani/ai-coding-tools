# Intelligent Commit Creation
Analyze staged changes and create meaningful commit:

1. Review all staged changes
2. Identify the type of changes (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
3. Generate clear, conventional commit message
4. Include relevant issue numbers if mentioned in: $ARGUMENTS
5. Ask for confirmation before committing

Follow conventional commit format and project standards.

Only add claude as a co-commiter if explicitly told by user.
