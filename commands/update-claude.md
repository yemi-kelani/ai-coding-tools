# CLAUDE.md Maintenance Command

Please help me maintain the CLAUDE.md file with the following task: $ARGUMENTS

## Context
This project uses a CLAUDE.md file to document AI/ML workflows, prompt engineering strategies, and Claude-specific configurations. 

## Your Tasks
1. **Content Analysis**: First, read the current CLAUDE.md file to understand its structure and content
2. **Task Execution**:
   - Update documentation sections with new information
   - Be clear and concise. Remove outdated information and replace with updates.
   - Add new sections for features, workflows, or configurations
   - Improve formatting and readability
   - Add or update code examples and prompts
   - Verify and update any references to Claude models or capabilities
   - Add timestamps or version information where relevant
   - Create or update table of contents if needed

## Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive headers with proper markdown hierarchy
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Add examples for complex concepts or workflows
- Ensure all Claude model references are current and accurate
- Include relevant badges, links, or metadata at the top
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation style

## Additional Considerations
- Check for any broken links or outdated information
- Ensure the document follows markdown best practices
- Add helpful comments or annotations where beneficial
- Consider adding a "Last Updated" timestamp
- Validate that examples and code snippets are functional

## Output
After completing the maintenance task, provide a brief summary of:
- What changes were made
- Any recommendations for future improvements
- Any issues or inconsistencies discovered

## Critical Objective
Be clear and concise. Remove redundant text but retain a large degree of detail. The CLAUDE.md file shouldn't repeat itself too much.
